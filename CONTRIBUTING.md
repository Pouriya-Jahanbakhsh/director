I love pull requests from everyone. By participating in this project, you
agree to abide by the **director** [code of conduct](https://thoughtbot.com/open-source-code-of-conduct).  

Fork, then clone the repo:
```sh
~ $ git clone git@github.com:your-username/director.git && cd director
```

Run tests before any changes and Make sure the tests pass:
```sh
~/director $ make test
...
```
Make your changes and run tests. Make sure the tests pass again. Add tests for your changes and again **Make sure the tests pass**.

Push to your fork and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/director/compare/).

At this point you're waiting on me. It's good to explain your idea in issues before.
